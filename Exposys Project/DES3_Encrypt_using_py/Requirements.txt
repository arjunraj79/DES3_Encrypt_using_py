Python: Ensure you have Python installed. This script is compatible with Python 3.x.

pycryptodome Library:

Installation: You need to install the pycryptodome library, which provides cryptographic functions.
Installation Command:
bash
Copy code
pip install pycryptodome
File System Access: The script requires access to the file system to read and write files. Ensure that the file paths provided exist and that you have the necessary permissions.

Summary of Required Components:
Python 3.x installed on your system.
pycryptodome library, which you can install using pip.
Proper file paths for the input file you wish to encrypt or decrypt.
A Triple DES (3DES) key for encryption/decryption.
Code Execution
Run the Script:

Save the script to a file, for example, file_crypto.py.
Execute the script using Python from the terminal:
bash
Copy code
python file_crypto.py
Follow Prompts:

The script will prompt you to choose between encryption and decryption.
Provide the file path and the key when prompted.
File Handling:

The script reads the file, performs the chosen operation (encrypt or decrypt), and writes the result back to the file.
Additional Notes
Key Size: The key provided should be 16 bytes in length. The md5 hash function is used to ensure the key is of the correct size.
Nonce Handling: The nonce is set to b'0', which may not be ideal for production environments. For better security, use a unique nonce for each encryption operation.
